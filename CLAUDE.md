# Pradixium — Working Notes for Claude

Read this before doing anything in this repo. It captures decisions, conventions, and
history that aren't obvious from the code alone.

## What Pradixium is

A property-investment analysis tool ("Reality Check™") — NOT a listings site, NOT a
market-data warehouse. The user brings a specific property; Pradixium tells them
whether the evidence actually supports the deal. Brand promise: "Don't buy the dream.
Check the reality."

## The one non-negotiable rule: data honesty

**Never state a number, rate, or rule without a verifiable, current, citable source.**
If a country/data point doesn't clear that bar, leave it out entirely — never guess,
estimate, or pad coverage. "Not enough verified evidence yet" is a completely
acceptable, expected outcome. This applies to code (`lib/scoring/*.js`,
`lib/data/*.js`) and to anything said to the user.

Consequence for future data sources: Pradixium refuses to build its own "independent"
valuation algorithm that hides its reasoning — every number is anchored to a real
government/market benchmark or the property's own economics (rent), and the report
says which. This is deliberate brand differentiation from black-box AVMs (e.g. Zillow
Zestimate), not a limitation to work around.

## No third-party data dependencies

Explicit standing instruction: don't build features that depend on a paid third-party
data vendor or scraping service (e.g. Apify-based auction scrapers, Yardi Matrix-style
institutional data platforms). If a feature needs external data, it must come from a
primary government/official source we access directly, or it doesn't ship. This ruled
out the "live foreclosure/auction watch" feature idea for Italy/Spain — no official API
exists there, only paid third-party scrapers — so it's shelved, not built.

## Working style with this user

The user is non-technical, Hebrew-primary, and has been very explicit about this:

- **One step at a time.** Don't give multi-step instructions for manual UI tasks
  (Vercel, GitHub, environment settings). Ask for a screenshot, give one instruction,
  wait for the next screenshot.
- **Never deploy to `main`/production without explicit approval.** Build the change,
  validate it (syntax check + a local screenshot via headless Chromium), show the
  screenshot, and wait for an explicit "yes/כן/מאשר" before pushing to `main`. Pending
  work goes to the feature branch only.
- Don't over-explain or narrate options at length — give a recommendation and the
  main tradeoff, not an essay.
- The user pushes back hard (and rightly) if Claude acts before confirming — treat
  that feedback as a hard rule, not a one-off.

## Brand separation from Sikul25/Degaja (important context, already done)

The original GitHub account (`Sikul25`) also publicly hosts `Degaja-2.0`, a tarot/
psychic-reading site. Having `Pradixium-` on the same public profile undermined the
"Reality Check" honesty positioning. This was fully resolved:

- Code now lives at `github.com/pradixium/Pradixium-1.0` (account `pradixium`,
  email `ceo@pradixium.com`), fully separate from Sikul25.
- Vercel project `pradixium` (team `Haluzim`) is connected to the new repo; the old
  `Sikul25/Pradixium-` repo has been deleted.
- Old repo's git history was NOT preserved in the new repo (deliberate fresh start —
  single squashed initial commit) to keep the migration simple and avoid the git
  protocol bug below.

## Known infra quirk: git push from this working directory

Raw `git push` from `/home/user/Pradixium-` (this session's original working
directory) to `pradixium/Pradixium-1.0` intermittently fails with:
```
fatal: expected 'acknowledgments', received 'packfile'
remote: fatal: did not receive expected object ...
```
This happens specifically when pushing a large/multi-commit pack (e.g. this
directory's full old history). It does NOT happen when pushing a small number of
commits. Also, this directory's `origin` remote has been observed to silently reset
back to the (now-deleted) `Sikul25/Pradixium-` URL between turns — always check
`git remote -v` and `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/pradixium/pradixium-1.0`
if a push fails with "repository not found."

**Reliable workaround**: a second clone at `/home/user/pradixium-1.0` (correct origin,
minimal linear history) is used for actual deploys — copy changed files there, commit,
`git push origin main` from that directory. Keep both directories' files in sync after
any change.

## Report watermark (shipped)

Every paid report (`report.html`) now stamps a notary-seal-style circular watermark:
Pradixium logo, "CERTIFIED · AUTHENTIC" on the top arc, analysis reference number +
date + time on the bottom arc. Positioned beside the property title (not centered over
the Score, which was tried and rejected). Identity/report-number comes from
`engine.js`'s `attachWatermark()`/`getWatermarkInfo()`, wired into both `openReport()`
and `handleCheckoutReturn()`. Never fabricates a placeholder if the real data isn't
available — just doesn't render.

## Reality Check™ exceptional-value flag (shipped)

`lib/scoring/realityCheck.js`'s `computeRealityCheck()` returns an additional
`exceptionalValue` field (separate from the PASS/FAIL verdict) when the asking price
is 35%+ below the government/market benchmark. `report.html` shows an amber
"Significantly Below Market — verify why" banner when set, in all 7 report languages.
Framed as "verify why," never "great deal" — an unusually good number gets the same
scrutiny as an unusually bad one, per the Reality Check philosophy. Uses only data
Pradixium already computes; no external listings/auction data involved.

## Future direction: US expansion (not started — blocked, then unblocked for NEW sessions only)

Stated goal: go global with major US metro penetration. Priority order given by the
user (population-based, open to reordering): New York, LA, Chicago, Dallas-Fort
Worth, Houston, Washington DC, Miami, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Phoenix — then a second
tier (Boston, Riverside, SF, Detroit, Seattle, Minneapolis, San Diego, Tampa, Denver,
St. Louis/Baltimore) — then rural/small markets last.

Key technical reality (already explained to the user, confirmed correct): the US has
no single national benchmark source like France's DVF or Spain's INE — real estate
records are per-county (~3,000+), each with its own system. What IS usable nationally:
the FHFA House Price Index (real, government, for price-momentum), state-level foreign-
ownership restriction laws (a real, recent, citable trend for a handful of states), and
per-county property tax rates (fairly stable, publicly documented). Street-level
transaction benchmarks require picking specific well-digitized counties one at a time
(Miami-Dade's `gis-mdc.opendata.arcgis.com` ArcGIS Open Data Hub looked promising —
official, free, real API — but was never actually verified due to network access).

**This work needs a session whose cloud environment has broader network access**
(this session's own environment could not be changed retroactively — only new
sessions pick up an environment change). Before starting: verify the actual data
source structure for the target county/site with WebFetch/WebSearch — don't write
scraping code against a guessed HTML structure.

## US coverage (built Sept 2026 — top 50 metros by Census 2024 population; local data for the top 20 first)

Working rules from the user for this work: build → verify (independent recompute
of at least one figure + screenshot) → push only fully-verified changes; never say
"impossible" — bring researched alternatives; always end with a Hebrew summary;
largest metro first.

- Every US address: FHFA metro HPI matched by county (`lib/data/usMetros.js`,
  generated from the Census/OMB files), FEMA flood zone, and — in California —
  CAL FIRE fire zones + CGS fault/liquefaction/landslide zones
  ("Location Risks & Regulation" section in results page and report).
- Local official sources: `lib/usLocal/*.js` (one module per verified source,
  registry in `lib/usLocal/index.js`) plus NYC/LA/NJ/NYS code inside
  `api/us-intelligence.js`. Only NJ's municipal median ($/sq ft of LIVING area,
  usable Treasury sales) feeds the verdict; everything else is context or a
  display-only "Government Value", because the area measure or the sale
  qualification is not strict enough.
- Generated data (re-run to refresh): `node scripts/build-nj-sales.mjs`
  (NJ Treasury SR1A, monthly) and `node scripts/build-fl-sales.mjs 2026P`
  (Florida DOR SDF+NAL, each new roll).
  `node scripts/build-stl-sales.mjs` (City of St. Louis Assessor sales +
  parcel Access files; needs mdbtools — the city's file currently ends Nov
  2024, so its ZIP figures are context only).
- St. Louis (#23): City (29510) = last valid sale (Assessor sale type 10) +
  appraised value + ZIP context; St. Louis County (29189) = facts +
  appraised value only (Missouri: the county publishes no sale prices).
- San Antonio (#24): Bexar (48029) in `lib/usLocal/texas.js` — BCAD final
  (post-protest) value from Bexar County GIS "Parcels" (reloaded each fall;
  no tax year in the layer, so none is shown).
- Austin (#25): Travis (48453) in `texas.js` — TCAD market value from Travis
  County TNR's published copy "TCAD_Parcels_Dec_2025" (2025 roll). TNR
  publishes dated copies: when a newer one appears, point the URL at it and
  update the label/year.
- Portland (#26): Multnomah/Washington/Clackamas via Oregon Metro RLIS
  `lib/usLocal/portlandMetro.js` — assessor Real Market Value + assessed
  value; RLIS SALEPRICE is unscreened, so not shown. Clark County WA (the
  Vancouver side) not yet covered.
- Sacramento (#27): not covered at property level — California publishes no
  sale prices and Prop 13 assessed values are not market values (same as
  Riverside/SF/SD).
- Pittsburgh (#28): Allegheny (42003) `lib/usLocal/allegheny.js`, live SQL on
  WPRDC — the county's VALID sales (SALECODE 0) + finished living area →
  ZIP benchmark that FEEDS THE VERDICT (like NJ), last valid sale, facts.
  The county's fair market value is 2012 base-year → text only. WPRDC's
  firewall only accepts a form-encoded POST with a User-Agent (the shared
  `h.json(url, ms, init)` now takes fetch options).
- Las Vegas (#29): Clark County NV (32003) `lib/usLocal/clarkNV.js` — last
  sale only when the Assessor's Sales_view code is R ("normally … arm's
  length", Assessor Sales Codes PDF); year built. No value in the GIS
  (Assessor bulk files are paid → not used). Addresses carried by two
  parcels (house + extra lot sold together) show nothing.
- Cincinnati (#30): Hamilton County OH (39061) `lib/usLocal/hamiltonOH.js` —
  Auditor market value, annual taxes (official check), year built, finished
  sq ft (text). Sales not shown: VALID/SALTYP empty on every 2025+ sale
  (checked Sept 2026). Kentucky/Butler/Warren/Clermont counties not covered.
- Kansas City (#31): not covered yet — Jackson County MO GIS
  (jcgis.jacksongov.org) times out from cloud IPs (sandbox + WebFetch);
  Johnson County KS publishes no parcel values. Retry Jackson from Vercel.
- Columbus (#32): Franklin County OH (39049) `lib/usLocal/franklinOH.js` —
  current appraised value, above-grade living area, beds/baths; last sale
  only if it is the parcel's latest sale AND in the Auditor's ValidSale='Y'
  file (that file covers Jan 2023–Jul 2025); ZIP context from it (fixed
  window from 2024-07-17), context only.
- Not yet covered at property level (metro trend + hazards only): Fort Worth
  (Tarrant — no valued open service), Nassau County NY (not in the NYS roll),
  Riverside / San Francisco / San Diego (California publishes no sale prices;
  SF's portal was rate-limiting during the build). Boston and Atlanta have no
  recent open sale data (values only).
- Sandbox quirk: Node's built-in fetch here ignores HTTPS_PROXY for some hosts
  (King County, DCAD fail with "upstream connect error"); run local tests with
  `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1`. Vercel production is unaffected — always confirm on
  the live site.
- The US endpoint has a 13 s internal budget (orchestrator allows 15 s); slow
  context queries get short timeouts so they can never drop the property's own
  record.

**Who builds what (two Claude sessions work on this repo):** US local data for
metros #23–#50 (St. Louis onward, in rank order) is being built by the session
titled "Pradixium 2.0 Beta" on branch `claude/ecstatic-hypatia-coi9oe`. Before
adding a US metro, check `lib/usLocal/index.js` on `origin/main` and this list,
so the same metro is never built twice.

## Lithuania (in progress)

The user's earlier "Italy/Spain/Lithuania data" request meant Lithuania's state
real-property register/cadastre — Registrų centras (registrucentras.lt).
Checked Sept 2026: registrucentras.lt and regia.lt sit behind a Cloudflare
challenge, data.gov.lt / get.data.gov.lt return a WAF "Attack ID" block page
and osp.stat.gov.lt returns 403 to cloud IPs — do not try to bypass them.
Plan: the user downloads the official open-data files in a normal browser and
they are turned into a generated data file (same pattern as NJ/FL).

Shipped: **Lithuania Auction Watch** (`lithuania-auctions.html` + `api/lt-auctions.js`)
— live bailiff (kind 1) and insolvency-administrator (kind 2) real-estate
auctions from evarzytynes.lt (Registrų centras). List pages only; never read
detail pages' contacts/owner names. Per-m² start price only for one whole
property in m² (not "1/4 dalis" shares, not multi-property lots). Fails closed
on format change. **Paused (Sept 2026, user's decision): removed from the live site
(page, API, "Distressed Assets" menu link) until Registrų centras confirms in
writing that showing the auctions with links back to them is fine.** To restore,
revert the "Take Distressed Assets off the live site" commit. The unreleased
"Government value" button (unique number + copy/open link to RC's mass-valuation
search, which Cloudflare blocks for servers incl. Vercel) is part of it. Shekel
prices were tried and dropped by the user — EUR only. Next: the RC "average
market value" (mass valuation) page as the Lithuanian benchmark.
